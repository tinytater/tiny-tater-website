						<h3>A Not So Spud-tacular Day...</h3>
						<p>It’s a warm, beautiful day at Potato Patch. The daffodils are blooming bright in the field with a lush scent of lavender breezing by as spring is in the air. Tater Tots, the youngest in his family, is happily decorating the house with his siblings, while his parents prepare a big feast. It’s his birthday and he is excited to be celebrate with his family and friends. Nothing could go wrong. Except the ceiling begins to shake wildly. Decorations come crashing down. All the Tots are in a state of confusion and shock. An indistinct hand rips the ceiling from above and snatches away some of the Tots, including Tater. The Gardener grabs hold of Tater and his siblings, carrying them all to an unbeknownst location, the kitchen. The Gardener places the Tots on a counter, except for Tater. The Gardener grabs a cutting board and places Tater on the board . Tater, now afraid, is ready for his life to end. A loud ring from a phone in a separate location is heard. The Gardener walks away towards the noise, leaving Tater behind. Tater, now separated from his siblings and having to fend for his life, realizes this isn’t the end and that now is his time to escape!</p>

									<p>The difference between Tiny Tater Adventures, compared to other existing Kawaii Potato games, is that we gave our Kawaii Potato (Tater) a backstory and personality. When you look up the origins of the Kawaii Potato, it lacks content. The page only describes the Kawaii Potato as an adorable Internet meme that has different facial expressions. Therefore, we decided to create a storyline for him, what kind of personality should he have, and what are the hardships he faces as a small potato.</p>
